#The data
Herb <- read.csv(file = "slides/Multivariante/data/Herbivore_specialisation.csv", header = TRUE)
head(Herb)

#Get the community matrix
library(reshape2)
Herbivores <- dcast(data = Herb, formula = Habitat + DayNight + Replicate + Mass ~ species,
                    fun.aggregate = sum, value.var = "abundance")

#simplify objects to use
Habitat <- Herbivores$Habitat
DayNight <- Herbivores$DayNight

#The basic is the distance measure you use:
#distance selection!----
?dist
?vegdist
?betadiver

#A few words:
#binary:
  #Jackard
  #Sorensen (This coefficient weights matches in species composition
              #between the two samples more heavily than mismatches)
#quantitative
  #Euclidian: simple distance, good for e.g. distance between sites
  #bray: 0-1 The Bray-Curtis measure ignores cases in which the species
      #is absent in both community samples, and it is dominated
      #by the abundant species so that rare species add very little to the
      #value of the coefficient
  #morisita: 0-1 independent of sample size. Only for counts. Recomended.
  #kulczynski: Weigth more rare species.
  #gower (allows factors!)

Herb_community.mds <- metaMDS(comm = Herb_community,
                              distance = "bray",

#assumptions:
Herb_community.mds$stress

#If the stress value is greater than 0.2, it is advisable to include an
#additional dimension, but remember that human brains are not very well
#equipped to visualise objects in more than 2-dimensions.

#Transformation and standardisation. Transforming data sets prior to
#creating a MDS plot is often desirable, not to meet assumptions of normality,
#but to reduce the influence of extreme values. For example,

Herb_community.sq <- sqrt(Herb_community)
Herb_community.sq.mds <- metaMDS(comm = Herb_community.sq,
                                 distance = "bray", trace = FALSE)
plot(Herb_community.sq.mds$points, col = Habitat, pch = 16)

#alternative plot
ordiplot(Herb_community.mds,type="n")
ordihull(Herb_community.mds,groups=Habitat,draw="polygon",col="grey90",
         label=FALSE)
orditorp(Herb_community.mds,display="species",col="red",air=0.01)

#Testing hypothesis PERMANOVA----
#First test: Are centroids different?
adonis(Herb_community ~ Habitat, method = "bray")
adonis(Herb_community ~ DayNight, method = "bray")
#Second test: Is the spread different?
b <- betadisper(vegdist(Herb_community, method = "bray"), group = Habitat)
anova(b)
boxplot(b)
TukeyHSD(b)

b <- betadisper(vegdist(Herb_community, method = "bray"), group = DayNight)

#There are a couple of problems with these kinds of analysis.
#First, their statistical power is very low, except for variables
#with high variance. This means that for variables which are less
#variable, the analyses are less likely to detect a treatment effect.
#Second, they do not account for a very important property of
#multivariate data, which is the mean-variance relationship.
#Typically, in multivariate datasets like species-abundance data
#sets, counts for rare species will have many zeros with little
#variance, and the higher counts for more abundant species will
#be more variable.

#The mvabund approach improves power across a range of species
#with different variances and includes an assumption of a mean-variance
#relationship. It does this by fitting a single generalised linear
#model (GLM) to each response variable with a common set of predictor
#variables. We can then use resampling to test for significant community
#level or species level responses to our predictors.

#mvabund way----
#create a mvabund object (similar to a data.frame)
Herb_spp <- mvabund(Herbivores[,5:11])
#explore data
boxplot(Herbivores[,5:11],horizontal = TRUE,las=2, main="Abundance")
meanvar.plot(Herb_spp, xlab = "mean", ylab = "variance")

#model ALL species at once fitting many GLM's that share error structure.
mod1 <- manyglm(Herb_spp ~ Herbivores$Habitat, family="poisson")
#check assumptions
plot(mod1)
#refit
mod2 <- manyglm(Herb_spp ~ Herbivores$Habitat, family="negative_binomial")
plot(mod2)
#test
anova(mod2) #slow
#See which species differ where
anova(mod2, p.uni="adjusted")
#Allows for model complexity
mod3 <- manyglm(Herb_spp ~ Herbivores$Habitat*Herbivores$DayNight,
                family="negative_binomial")
anova(mod3)
